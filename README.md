Python xss scripts 

This Python code simulates a basic XSS attack by demonstrating how an attacker could inject a maliciousscript into a web application. The VulnerableWebApp class represents a web application that has a login function that is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The XSSAttack class contains a method exploit that simulates the attack by printing the payload. In a real-world scenario, the payload would be sent to the server and executed in the context of the web page, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, hijack user accounts, or perform other malicious actions.
